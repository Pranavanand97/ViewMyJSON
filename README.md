# ViewMyJSON
This is a project that i have done when i faced an issue to open a .JSON format file in my native environment (Windows). So i thought of making a Website to do the same with a lil bit of JavaScript + HTML + Tailwind CSS.

All those who are looking for Dynamic text copying using JS can look at this code.
